//! # Pinocchio
//!
//! Pinocchio is a zero-dependency library to create Solana programs in Rust.
//! It takes advantage of the way SVM loaders serialize the program input parameters
//! into a byte array that is then passed to the program's entrypoint to define
//! zero-copy types to read the input â€“ these types are defined in an efficient way
//! taking into consideration that they will be used in on-chain programs.
//!
//! It is intended to be used by on-chain programs only; for off-chain programs,
//! use instead the [`solana-sdk`] crate.
//!
//! [`solana-sdk`]: https://docs.rs/solana-sdk/latest/solana_sdk/
//!
//! ## Defining the program entrypoint
//!
//! A Solana program needs to define an entrypoint, which will be called by the
//! runtime to begin the program execution. The `entrypoint!` macro emits the common
//! boilerplate to set up the program entrypoint. The macro will also set up [global
//! allocator](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/core/alloc/trait.GlobalAlloc.html)
//! and [panic handler](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/panic-handler.html) using
//! the [`default_allocator!`] and [`default_panic_handler!`] macros.
//!
//! The [`entrypoint!`] is a convenience macro that invokes three other macros to set
//! all symbols required for a program execution:
//!
//! * [`program_entrypoint!`]: declares the program entrypoint
//! * [`default_allocator!`]: declares the default (bump) global allocator
//! * [`default_panic_handler!`]: declares the default panic handler
//!
//! To use the `entrypoint!` macro, use the following in your entrypoint definition:
//! ```ignore
//! use pinocchio::{
//!   account_info::AccountInfo,
//!   entrypoint,
//!   msg,
//!   ProgramResult,
//!   pubkey::Pubkey
//! };
//!
//! entrypoint!(process_instruction);
//!
//! pub fn process_instruction(
//!   program_id: &Pubkey,
//!   accounts: &[AccountInfo],
//!   instruction_data: &[u8],
//! ) -> ProgramResult {
//!   msg!("Hello from my program!");
//!   Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The information from the input is parsed into their own entities:
//!
//! * `program_id`: the `ID` of the program being called
//! * `accounts`: the accounts received
//! * `instruction_data`: data for the instruction
//!
//! Pinocchio also offers variations of the program entrypoint
//! ([`lazy_program_entrypoint`]) and global allocator ([`no_allocator`]). In
//! order to use these, the program needs to specify the program entrypoint,
//! global allocator and panic handler individually. The [`entrypoint!`] macro
//! is equivalent to writing:
//! ```ignore
//! program_entrypoint!(process_instruction);
//! default_allocator!();
//! default_panic_handler!();
//! ```
//! Any of these macros can be replaced by other implementations and Pinocchio
//! offers a couple of variants for this.
//!
//! ### [`lazy_program_entrypoint!`]
//!
//! The [`entrypoint!`] macro looks similar to the "standard" one found in
//! [`solana-program`](https://docs.rs/solana-program-entrypoint/latest/solana_program_entrypoint/macro.entrypoint.html).
//! It parses the whole input and provides the `program_id`, `accounts` and
//! `instruction_data` separately. This consumes compute units before the program
//! begins its execution. In some cases, it is beneficial for a program to have
//! more control when the input parsing is happening, even whether the parsing
//! is needed or not &mdash; this is the purpose of the [`lazy_program_entrypoint!`]
//! macro. This macro only wraps the program input and provides methods to parse
//! the input on-demand.
//!
//! The [`lazy_program_entrypoint`] is suitable for programs that have a single
//! or very few instructions, since it requires the program to handle the parsing,
//! which can become complex as the number of instructions increases. For *larger*
//! programs, the [`program_entrypoint!`] will likely be easier and more efficient
//! to use.
//!
//! To use the [`lazy_program_entrypoint!`] macro, use the following in your
//! entrypoint definition:
//! ```ignore
//! use pinocchio::{
//!   default_allocator,
//!   default_panic_handler,
//!   entrypoint::InstructionContext,
//!   lazy_program_entrypoint,
//!   msg,
//!   ProgramResult
//! };
//!
//! lazy_program_entrypoint!(process_instruction);
//! default_allocator!();
//! default_panic_handler!();
//!
//! pub fn process_instruction(
//!   mut context: InstructionContext
//! ) -> ProgramResult {
//!     msg!("Hello from my lazy program!");
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The [`InstructionContext`](entrypoint::InstructionContext) provides on-demand
//! access to the information of the input:
//!
//! * [`remaining()`](entrypoint::InstructionContext::remaining): number of available
//!   accounts to parse; this number is decremented as the program parses accounts.
//! * [`next_account()`](entrypoint::InstructionContext::next_account): parses the
//!   next available account (can be used as many times as accounts available).
//! * [`instruction_data()`](entrypoint::InstructionContext::instruction_data): parses
//!   the instruction data.
//! * [`program_id()`](entrypoint::InstructionContext::program_id): parses the
//!   program id.
//!
//!
//! ðŸ’¡ The [`lazy_program_entrypoint!`] does not set up a global allocator nor a panic
//! handler. A program should explicitly use one of the provided macros to set them
//! up or include its own implementation.
//!
//! ### [`no_allocator!`]
//!
//! When writing programs, it can be useful to make sure the program does not attempt
//! to make any allocations. For this cases, Pinocchio includes a [`no_allocator!`]
//! macro that set a global allocator just panics at any attempt to allocate memory.
//!
//! To use the [`no_allocator!`] macro, use the following in your entrypoint definition:
//! ```ignore
//! use pinocchio::{
//!   account_info::AccountInfo,
//!   default_panic_handler,
//!   msg,
//!   no_allocator,
//!   program_entrypoint,
//!   ProgramResult,
//!   pubkey::Pubkey
//! };
//!
//! program_entrypoint!(process_instruction);
//! default_panic_handler!();
//! no_allocator!();
//!
//! pub fn process_instruction(
//!   program_id: &Pubkey,
//!   accounts: &[AccountInfo],
//!   instruction_data: &[u8],
//! ) -> ProgramResult {
//!   msg!("Hello from `no_std` program!");
//!   Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//!
//! ðŸ’¡ The [`no_allocator!`] macro can also be used in combination with the
//! [`lazy_program_entrypoint!`].
//!
//! ## `std` crate feature
//!
//! By default, Pinocchio is a `no_std` crate. This means that it does not use any
//! code from the standard (`std`) library. While this does not affect how Pinocchio
//! is used, there is a one particular apparent difference. In a `no_std` environment,
//! the [`msg!`] macro does not provide any formatting options since the `format!` macro
//! requires the `std` library. In order to use [`msg!`] with formatting, the `std`
//! feature should be enable when adding Pinocchio as a dependency:
//! ```ignore
//! pinocchio = { version = "0.7.0", features = ["std"] }
//! ```
//!
//! Instead of enabling the `std` feature to be able to format log messages with [`msg!`],
//! it is recommended to use the [`pinocchio-log`](https://crates.io/crates/pinocchio-log)
//! crate. This crate provides a lightweight `log!` macro with better compute units
//! consumption than the standard `format!` macro without requiring the `std` library.
//!
//! ## Advanced entrypoint configuration
//!
//! The symbols emitted by the entrypoint macros &mdash; program entrypoint, global
//! allocator and default panic handler &mdash; can only be defined once globally. If
//! the program crate is also intended to be used as a library, it is common practice
//! to define a Cargo [feature](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html)
//! in your program crate to conditionally enable the module that includes the [`entrypoint!`]
//! macro invocation. The convention is to name the feature `bpf-entrypoint`.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! #[cfg(feature = "bpf-entrypoint")]
//! mod entrypoint {
//!   use pinocchio::{
//!     account_info::AccountInfo,
//!     entrypoint,
//!     msg,
//!     ProgramResult,
//!     pubkey::Pubkey
//!   };
//!
//!   entrypoint!(process_instruction);
//!
//!   pub fn process_instruction(
//!     program_id: &Pubkey,
//!     accounts: &[AccountInfo],
//!     instruction_data: &[u8],
//!   ) -> ProgramResult {
//!     msg!("Hello from my program!");
//!     Ok(())
//!   }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! When building the program binary, you must enable the `bpf-entrypoint` feature:
//! ```ignore
//! cargo build-sbf --features bpf-entrypoint
//! ```
